This is a 5 minute [KSWISS](http://www.kswiss.com/) advertisement, and at the end I wasn't even upset that I watched a 5 minute commercial. Matt Cassel's part was my favorite, with Mark Cuban's a close second. It is pretty explicit so be cautious where you're watching it.

Don't know who Kenny Powers is? Check out [HBO](http://www.hbo.com/)'s [Eastbound and Down](http://www.hbo.com/eastbound-and-down/index.html).
