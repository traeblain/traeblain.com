This is another time waster. Simply clicking on the screen allows you to produce multi-colored arrows, when you click on the other side of the screen you produce black arrows. The black arrows hunt the color arrows, the color arrows want to be as close to your mouse pointer as possible. If your colored arrows get hit, the splatter in multi-colored pastel carnage. Have fun!
