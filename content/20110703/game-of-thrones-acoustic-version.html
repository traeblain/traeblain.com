This guy recorded the excellent theme to HBO's Game of Thrones, playing each part and mixing them together. It's an excellent cover and excellent song. You can even download the song here: [Game of Thrones (Acoustic)](http://www.mediafire.com/?u4ddxz1v0yrfpta) 

You may or may not know, I'm a huge fan of good acoustic covers. If you know of some let me know...I've got an old post somewhere on some really good acoustic rap covers I'll have to pull back out. Realize I said _good_ acoustic covers, your cousin's YouTube video in front of the microphone that's mounted in the monitor do not count...
