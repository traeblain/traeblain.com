The free CAD program space is really bad. There are some decent programs out there, but none of them offer the intuitive interfaces that Autodesk, PTC, SolidEdge, and Siemens provide. I haven't tried this yet, but I really hope it provides the kind of tools that allow hobbyists to do real parametric modeling. I'm kind of pumped about this product...I'll let you know.
