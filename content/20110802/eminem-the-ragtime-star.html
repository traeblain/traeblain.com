If you didn't know, Eminem was a 1920's ragtime star that wasn't accepted for his progressive lyrics and was driven to Tesla's super-secret cryogenics lab near a small neighborhood called Dallas. This he did to freeze himself before society attacked and killed him.

Upon the cryogenic chamber completely failing to resist the crazy heat wave of 1980, the chamber was shipped to Detroit in hopes GM's labs could keep him frozen and in hopes a cooler climate would help. After only a few years and in the early 90's was required to take on a new identity provided by the US Government.

Mr. Mathers instantly found a home in the rap music scene as he felt the only genre of music that would accept his progressive style. And now we have the Eminem that we know of today...true story.
