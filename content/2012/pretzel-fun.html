Check it out. I was bored while my son was finishing eating that I started this simple project. Turns out a pretzel is an amazingly shaped object.

Other than the 'A', most every other letter is instantly recognizable. I also couldn't clean up the 'S' because every time I tried it would break. So it looks more like a backwards 'Z'.

So enjoy the 'Pretzel Alphabet'.
